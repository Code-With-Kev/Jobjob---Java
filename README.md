# Job<job<job>>
A full-stack Java/SpringBoot application designed to be a job board for new coding graduates. Coders will have a safe place to go to knowing that all employers on the site are already aware that they do not have experience and are still willing to give them an oppurtunity. No long resume process, no forcefully typed cover letters, just pure, untapped talent.

 In the coding world, rubber ducks are used as object for developers to talk through debugging problems with. My duck, Oogie, has helped me solved some of the world's most advance problems, such as, "Oh, I didn't see the extra semicolon 645 lines up" and "Ahhh, I forgot to save before viewing", so I figured I'd share him with the world!

Bi-weekly I will create a new login animation for our screen. It gives people a reason to come back and helps ease the tension of trying to find a job.
