# Job<job<job>>
A full-stack Java/SpringBoot application designed to be a job board for new coding graduates. Coders will have a safe place to go to knowing that all employers on the site are already aware that they do not have experience and are still willing to give them an oppurtunity. No long resume process, no forcefully typed cover letters, just pure, untapped talent.

In the coding world, rubber ducks are used as object for developers to talk through debugging problems with. My duck, Oogie, has helped me solved some of the world's most advance problems, such as, "Oh, I didn't see the extra semicolon 645 lines up" and "Ahhh, I forgot to save before viewing", so I figured I'd share him with the world!

When you leave bootcamp, It feels like you're being dumped in the middle of an ocean after just learning how to swim. Believe me, I know. I wanted to reflect that with our login animation. Bi-weekly, I will create a new login animation for our screen. It gives people a reason to come back and helps ease the tension of trying to find a job.

 ## User Dashboard

This might be my favorite page on the site. By signing up, your user dashboard essentially becomes a template for your portfolio page to send to recruiters. No more worrying about how to present all the work you've done. We have you covered so that you can focus on making world changing projects! The site will scan your code, detect what percentage of of a language is present in a project and display it. Employers can then search for projects to look at and filter them based on the languages they are looking for. Everyone wins! 
 
 ## Job Submission

I am a strong proponent for people knowing their worth. You're probably thinking, "I've just graduated and barely have any experience... HOW COULD I POSSIBLY KNOW MY WORTH!!!". I got you! Early in my editing career, I accepted many jobs that I now realize underpaid me. I want to try to relieve that stress for everyone else. Therefore, when a job is submitted into our system, a salary is required (employers will have an option to keep it private). If the salary you have written down is more than $3000 less than the Glassdoor statistic for the average salary of a junior developer in your state, it cannot be submitted. Users who get a job will have an option to send us their salary while working in order to be sure that they are being paid adequately. So if a job is on our site, rest assured that you will be getting your money's worth! 
 
 ## Pure SCSS

No bootstrap, no premade components, everything is either made in Adobe Suite or from SCSS! So I have full control over everything on the front end.

Here is the special section of the site where we tell users what's coming up! Next up will be an Algo Challenge page where recruiters get to challenge candidates to algos that their company specifically wants their employers to know. Students can build up a track record with companies to prove that they are interested whenever you start hiring again.
